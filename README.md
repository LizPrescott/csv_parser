To run this file:
1. Clone and navigate into this repo (obviously)
2. Install Ruby 2.5.1 
3. Install necessary gems: `gem install activesupport`
4. Run `ruby truss.rb` in the terminal


If I took more time with this exercise, I would:
- Finish the rest of the columns
- Refactor my methods to separate their concerns (ideally, one each)
- Make this a reusable class
- Create a new_file method that would create a revised CSV from the data created by my parser method
